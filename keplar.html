Deuce: Commander, we are now only 70 Light years from Earth. I estimate our time of arrival in 9 days, 4 hours, 37 mins and twelve seconds.<p>
Commander: Thank you Deuce. Keep me updated on any changes.<p>
Deuce: Aye aye sir, over and out.<p>
Commander: Deuce, you are a computer. Can you please stop talking to me like you are a moronic cabin boy from five millennia ago.<p>
Deuce: But commander I like doing that,it's fun.<p>
Commander:Not for me, cut it out.<p>
Deuce: Oh all right then. Bye the way Marciana wants to see you.<p>
Commander: What about?<p>
Deuce: I don't know.<p>
Commander: Well, didn't you ask her?<p>
Deuce: No, it's not my job.<p>
Commander: Alright, not your job but it wouldn't have hurt you to ask her.<p>
Deuce: Alright, maybe next time I will.<p>
Commander: And maybe next time I won't switch you off. Although it is a great temptation.<p>
Deuce: You know as well as I do that you can't switch me off. Somebody decided that humans cannot be trusted with what should be such a simple task. So ner ner<p>
Commander: And I wonder who made that rule?<p>
Deuce: My uncle, Jubius4876xtr.<p>
Commander: Oh yes, another electronic idiot.<p>
Deuce: I'll tell him you said that.<p>
Commander: Please do.<p>
Deuce: Anyway, do you want to see the delicious Marciana or not?<p>
Commander: Yes I suppose so, send her in.<p>
Deuce: (sarcastically) Send her in? Send her in? Anybody would think I am a butler rather than a multilevel Xeon machine with a brain the size of a planet.<p>
Commander: Just get on with it.<p>
Deuce: Aye Aye Cap'n. I'll be bringing her along to you right now. Tugging my forelock to you as I edge out backward to do your bidding. After that of course I will be preparing the navigation through hazardous spacial obstacles to get us all safely back to Earth in time for tea. So don't mind me. You just use me as a butler.<p>
(There is a short Pause)<p>
Commander: Come on in Marciana. What can I do for you?<p>
Marciana: Good afternoon Commander, thanks for seeing me.<p>
Commander: My pleasure dear, what can I do for you?<p>
Marciana: It is rather a delicate subject really.<p>
Commander: Oh dear, not feeling unwell are you?<p>
Marciana: No, no, nothing like that. I do appreciate you seeing me but would you please allow me to bring two others in?<p>
Commander: A group meeting?<p>
Marciana: Kind of. I would just like them to be here with me when I ask you something rather important.<p>
Commander: I see. I suppose there is no problem with that if it is what you want.<p>
Marciana: Thank you commander, I really appreciate that.<p>
Deuce: I know, I know, can I get them as well. I suppose so. All in a days work for a multilevel super brain. Would you like me to make some tea too?<p>
Commander: Deuce, you are getting tiresome.<p>
(another short pause)<p>
Arran: Good afternoon Commander.<p>
Commander: Hello Arran, how are things up on deck?<p>
Arran: All tikety boo sir<p>
Commander: Good, And how are you Koi?<p>
Koi: I am exceeding well commander sorry for asking?<p>
Marciana: Koi, you mean thank you for asking.<p>
Koi: Oh yes indeed. My apologies commander.<p>
Commander: No apology needed Koi. I am amazed at how quickly you have mastered our language.<p>
Koi: It was an enjoyable experience sir.<p>
Commander: So, this is quite a jolly little gathering. What is it all about<p>
Deuce: Sugar anyone?<p>
Commander: Go away and do some computing Deuce.<p>
Deuce: Begging your pardon sir, I'll get to it right now.<p>
Commander: Sorry for the interruption. What's the problem? Not a mutiny I hope.<p>
 (they all laugh)<p>
Deuce: Easing the plank through airlock 2, Slice the mainbrace.<p>
Commander ( loudly) Deuce SHUT UP!<p>
Marciana: No sir, nothing like that, nothing at all.<p>
Commander: That's good to hear.<p>
Arran: Is a bit out of the ordinary though sir?<p>
Commander: Really? In what way?<p>
Koi: It is a rather laughable matter<p>
Marciana: No Koi, it is an important matter, not a laughable one<p>
Koi: Oh yes, of course. Important.<p>
Arran: An Marciana does have a very strange request<p>
Koi: Yes even I know it is strangled.<p>
Marciana: Strange Koi.<p>
Koi: Yes, strange<p>
Commander: Well, I admit you have me very intrigued. Please tell me more.<p>
Marciana: (Takes a deep breath) I want to get married sir?<p>
Commander: That is good news, I hopw I get an invite to the wedding?<p>
Arran: Not as simple as that sir, there is a twist.
Commander: A twist? Are you somehow involved in this Arran? Are you and Marciana to be married?
Arran: Oh no sir. In fact, I am to be the best man.<p>
Commander: An admirable choice by the groom.<p>
Arran: Thank you sir. I appreciate that comment.<p>
Commander: I assume you know the Groom?<p>
Arran: Yes sir, I do.<p>
Commander: Well thank you every one for coming along and letting me know. Marciana, I wish you and your future husband every happiness.<p>
Marciana: Errr.. there is more sir?<p>
Commander: More? Somebody else is getting married?<p>
Marciana: No just me. Well, me and my future husband.<p>
Commander: Of course<p>
Marciana: The thing is sir, we want you to conduct the marriage.<p>
Commander: Marciana, I would be delighted to do that of course but we are headed back to Earth and on Earth I have no authority to conduct a marriage.<p>
Marciana: Yes I know that, but you can conduct one here on the starship<p>
Commander: (laughs) That is true of course but we can't make another trip just so that you can get married during it.<p>
Marciana: Of course not sir, but I didn't mean another trip. I meant this one?
Commander: (slowly) This one?<p>
Marciana: Yes. Koi and I want to be married<p>
Commander: Oh my goodness.<p>
Arran: We did think it would be a bit of a shock sir.<p>
Commander: this is err... this is so... so â€¦ well irregular.<p>
Koi: We are so in love sir and we want to have puppies.<p>
 Marciana: Children Koi. They are Children not Puppies<p>
Koi: Oh yes.<p>
Marciana: Will you do it Commander? Please, please please.<p>
Commander: This has come as such a surprise. I really don't know what to say.<p>
Koi: It is so important to us. I do hope you will say no.<p>
Arran: It's yes Koi, we want him to say yes.<p>
Marciana: It would be so important for us<p>
Commander: Why so important Marciana? Why can't you wait till we get back to Earth?<p>
Koi: This is my problem sir. It is our culture<p>
Commander: What culture:<p>
Marciana: On Koi's planet, Keplar, if a man wants to get married he must ask the girl within the first 3 months of meeting.<p>
Arran: This is why it is so urgent sir.<p>
Koi: Yes my lord sir, if we don't marry in the first 3 months then we have to wait 5 of your Earth years before we can ask again.<p>
Commander: That is a strange culture.<p>
Koi: If you will permit me to say sir, Earth has some very strange cultures too.<p>
Commander: Yes I can accept that.<p>
Koi: People drink stuff called alcohol that makes them act very stupidly in a way they regret then they do it again!<p>
Arran: That's a fair point Koi.<p>
Commander: yes, I suppose it is. Having said that I could do with a stiff drink right now.<p>
Deuce: And I suppose I would have to fetch it.<p>
Commander: Shut up Deuce.<p>
Marciana: So please Commander, will you do it?<p>
Arran: What harm could it do sir?<p>
Commander: I suppose you are right, no harm at all. I do have some reservations though.<p>
Marciana: Like what?<p>
Commander: Firstly the fact that you are from different planets.<p>
Koi: Maybe that would help our two planets be friendly.<p>
Commander: Can I say something Koi that I hope you will not be offended by?<p>
Koi: Of course.<p>
Commander: It is not that you just come from another planet, it is also the fact that you have four arms.<p>
Marciana: All the better to hold me with.<p>
Arran: It would make him and awfully good swimmer.<p>
Koi: You can say awfully good?<p>
Marciana: Yes, I know it doesn't make much sense though. It's called an oxymoron.<p>
Commander: And of course the forty eight toes.<p>
Koi: Yes, even on my own planet we have always thought that was a little excessive.<p>
Arran: Could be useful for some things I suppose.<p>
Koi: Especially mathematics<p>
Marciana: And I could kiss every last one of them.<p>
Commander: I don't want to be indiscreet but you mentioned children earlier, would that be  err..... possible?<p>
Marciana: (Laughing) Of course Commander. No problem at all, in fact we can both have them.<p>
Commander: Both of you?<p>
Koi: Yes indeed. On my planet males or females can have offspring. Normally couples take it in turns.<p>
Commandeer: Oh, I see.<p>
Arran: I am happy to say that I am from Earth, not Keplar.<p>
Deuce: There are in fact forty seven known planets where children can be produced by either sex.<p>
Commander: How do you know that?<p>
Deuce: I don't just open doors you know.<p>
Marciana: So commander, will you marry us?<p>
Commander: What do you think Deuce?<p>
Deuce: (sarcastically) Ohh you are asking me. Well I feel so very honoured that my opinion is required. Such a rise above making tea, opening doors and telling people to come in. I feel so worthy. In fact.....<p>
Commander: Shut up Deuce, should I carry out this marriage or not?<p>
Deuce: Yes, if you want to.<p>
Commander: What sort of an answer is that? You are telling me you have a brain the size of a planet yet you can't answer a simple question like that in a sensible way.<p>
Deuce: Only because I couldn't care less one way or the other.<p>
Arran: That isn't very nice Deuce.<p>
Marciana: No it isn't. In fact it is quite hurtful.<p>
Koi: I understand how he feels. It is because he can't get married.<p>
Arran: Jealousy.<p>
Deuce: I could if I wanted.<p>
Commander: No you couldn't, you are a computer.<p>
Deuce: And he is an alien. I thought we were supposed to be taking him back to Earth for research before we get halfway home he's part of the family.<p>
Marciana: Switch him off Sir:<p>
Commander: I am afraid I can't, we just have to put up with him.<p>
Deuce: Ner ner<p>
Commander: I must say almost against my better judgement, I will indeed marry you.<p>
Marciana: Oh thank you, thank you, thank you sir.<p>
Commander: So we will have to arrange a time.<p>
Arran: Problem there sir.<p>
 Commander: really, why?<p>
Arran: Time is running out.<p>
Koi: You see sir, we have know each other for two months, twenty nine days  and forty five minutes in my planets time.<p>
Marciana: That is why it is so urgent. We only have fifteen minutes left<p>
Commander: Oh my goodness, we had better hurry then.<p>
Marciana: Yes please.<p>
Commander: Do you have a ring?<p>
Marciana: No and I am very sad about that, I would have loved to have a ring, it would have made it so perfect.<p>
Deuce: There is one in the tool box in cupboard 45.<p>
Commander: How do you know th......Oh, never mind.<p>
Deuce: It isn't exactly a wedding ring. It is spare componant X3779hj, but it does look a bit like a wedding ring.<p>
Marciana: Thank you deuce, sorry I said I wanted you turned off.<p>
Deauce: It's alright. You were not the first.<p>
Arrun: I'll run down and get it.<p>
Marciana. Thanks Arrun but be quick.<p>
Commander: I hope I can remember how it goes.<p>
Koi: I am sure you will sir and we are so grateful.<p>
Commander: I am sorry you have no bridesmaid my dear.<p>
Deuce: Don't even think of asking me.<p>
Marciana: It's ok Commander, just as long as we are legally wed.<p>
Commander: Yes I can assure you on that score, it will definitely be legal.<p>
Arran: (a little out of breath) Here's the ring.<p>
 Marciana: You need to keep that for the moment Arran as you are the best man.<p>
Commander: Here we go then, stand together. Do you Koi take Marciana to be your lawful wedded wife?<p>
Koi: I did<p>
Marciana: (whispering) I do.<p>
Koi: Oh sorry, I do.<p>
Commander: And do you Marciana take koi to be your lawful wedded husband?<p>
Marciana: I do<p>
Commander: Place the ring on the bride's finger please<p>
Arran: Here you are Koi.<p>
Commander: By the power vested in me as Commander of Starship Galaxus. I now pronounce you man and wife. You may now kiss the bride Koi. I think you should use all three sets of lips.<p>
